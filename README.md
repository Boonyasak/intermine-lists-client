# InterMine Lists Client "TÃ¶skur"

A client side app maintaining InterMine Lists offering folder/tag organization and live searches.

The app is powered by [Chaplin](https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin) that itself wraps [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/).

## Stack

The whole stack is built on top of the [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) platform, make sure it is installed.

### Brunch
[Brunch](http://brunch.io/) is a HTML5 application builder that's agnostic to programming langs and frameworks.

`config.coffee` contains brunch configuration, `package.json` contains brunch plugins and node config.

For the latest in Brunch documentation, head over to [Read the Docs](http://brunch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

### Chaplin
[Chaplin](https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin) is a framework on top of [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) that adds some great predefined structure, like `ModelView`, `Controller`, `mediator`, `Application`.

We further extend it by adding classes such as the `Garbage` one, that consumes objects to dispose of automatically when they are no longer needed.

All `View` objects, when instantiated, will publish a message on the `notification` channel saying that they have rendered.

### Eco
[Eco](https://github.com/sstephenson/eco/) lets you embed CoffeeScript logic in your markup. It's like EJS and ERB, but with CoffeeScript inside.

### Flatiron
[Flatiron](http://flatironjs.org/) is used to serve files and data. Does not play a large role here.
